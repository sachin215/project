Virtual Environment
It is suggested to have a dedicated virtual environment for each Django project, and one way to manage a virtual environment is venv, which is included in Python.

The name of the virtual environment is your choice, in this tutorial we will call it myworld.

Type the following in the command prompt, remember to navigate to where you want to create your project:

python -m venv myworld
This will set up a virtual environment, and create a folder named "myworld" with subfolders and files, like this:

myworld
  Include
  Lib
  Scripts
  .gitignore
  pyvenv.cfg
Then you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:

Windows:

myworld\Scripts\activate.bat
Unix/MacOS:

source myworld/bin/activate


create project

django-admin startproject my_tennis_club


create app

python manage startapp app_name
